    <h3 class="title">Best Cities to Visit</h3>
    <p class="word">China, officially the People's Republic of China, is a country in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017. Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers, it is the world's third or fourth largest country by area. China is huge, and diverse in landscape and culture. We have selected China’s most popular cities for tourism, to help you narrow down your choices and maximize your time discovering the highlights of China.Almost all of us are familiar with the great man-made attractions in China: The Forbidden City in Beijing. The Terracotta Warriors of Xi'an. Shanghai's skyscraper forest in Pudong.
        For a country of its massive size and varied geography, however, it's surprising how relatively few people outside China appreciate the extent of the country's other destinations, many of them natural wonders to rival any in the world.A vacation to China for one week usually costs around ¥3,252 for one person. So, a trip to China for two people costs around ¥6,505 for one week. A trip for two weeks for two people costs ¥13,010 in China.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Food</h1>
        <div>
        <h3 class="detail">Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Overseas Chinese who have settled in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.

            The preference for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial, royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisines. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.
            
            The most praised "Four Major Cuisines" are Chuan, Lu, Yue and Huaiyang, representing West, North, South and East China cuisine correspondingly. The modern "Eight Cuisines" of China are Anhui (徽菜; Huīcài), Cantonese (粤菜; Yuècài), Fujian (闽菜; Mǐncài), Hunan (湘菜; Xiāngcài), Jiangsu (苏菜; Sūcài), Shandong (鲁菜; Lǔcài), Sichuan (川菜; Chuāncài), and Zhejiang (浙菜; Zhècài) cuisines.
            
            Color, smell and taste are the three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food,[4] as well as the meaning, appearance and nutrition of the food. Cooking should be appraised with respect to the ingredients used, knifework, cooking time and seasoning. </h3>
